        <h2>A Time Line of Katsushika Hokusai's Life</h2>
        <ul class="time_line_items">
            <li>Hokusai's date of birth is unclear, but is often stated as the 23rd day of the 9th month of the 10th year of the Hōreki era (in the old calendar, or 31 October 1760) to an artisan family, in the Katsushika district of Edo, Japan.</li>
            <li>At the age of 12, his father sent him to work in a bookshop and lending library, a popular institution in Japanese cities, where reading books made from wood-cut blocks was a popular entertainment of the middle and upper classes.</li>
            <li>At 14, he worked as an apprentice to a wood-carver, until the age of 18, when he entered the studio of Katsukawa Shunshō. Shunshō was an artist of ukiyo-e, a style of woodblock prints and paintings that Hokusai would master.</li>
            <li>Hokusai published his first prints, a series of pictures of Kabuki actors published in 1779. </li>
            <li>Upon the death of Shunshō in 1793, Hokusai began exploring other styles of art, including European styles he was exposed to through French and Dutch copper engravings he was able to acquire. He was soon expelled from the Katsukawa school by Shunkō, the chief disciple of Shunshō</li>
            <li>By 1800, Hokusai was further developing his use of ukiyo-e for purposes other than portraiture. He had also adopted the name he would most widely be known by, Katsushika Hokusai. That year, he published two collections of landscapes, Famous Sights of the Eastern Capital and Eight Views of Edo.</li>
            <li>In 1811, at the age of 51, Hokusai changed his name to Taito and entered the period in which he created the Hokusai Manga and various etehon, or art manuals. These etehon, beginning in 1812 with Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing, served as a convenient way to make money and attract more students. Manga (meaning random drawings) included studies in perspective.</li>
            <li>In 1839, a fire destroyed Hokusai's studio and much of his work. By this time, his career was beginning to fade as younger artists such as Andō Hiroshige became increasingly popular.</li>
            <li>At the age of 83, Hokusai traveled to Obuse in Shinano Province (now Nagano Prefecture) at the invitation of a wealthy farmer, Takai Kozan where he stayed for several years. During his time in Obuse, he created several masterpieces, included the Masculine Wave and the Feminine Wave.</li>
            <li>Hokusai never stopped painting and completed Ducks in a Stream at the age of 87.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="quote">Following his passion and always continuing to learn he states &quot;If only Heaven will give me just another ten years ... Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter.&quot;</p>
